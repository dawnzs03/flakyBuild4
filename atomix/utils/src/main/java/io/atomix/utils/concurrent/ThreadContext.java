/**
 * Thread context.
 *
 * <p>The thread context is used by Atomix to determine the correct thread on which to execute
 * asynchronous callbacks. All threads created within Catalyst must be instances of {@link
 * AtomixThread}. Once a thread has been created, the context is stored in the thread object via
 * {@link AtomixThread#setContext(ThreadContext)}. This means there is a one-to-one relationship
 * between a context and a thread. That is, a context is representative of a thread and provides an
 * interface for firing events on that thread.
 *
 * <p>Components of the framework that provide custom threads should use {@link AtomixThreadFactory}
 * to allocate new threads and provide a custom {@link ThreadContext} implementation.
