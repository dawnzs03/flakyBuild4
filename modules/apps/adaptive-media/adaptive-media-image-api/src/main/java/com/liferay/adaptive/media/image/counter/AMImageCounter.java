/**
 * Provides an interface that returns the number of images that can use Adaptive

 * This interface should be implemented by applications that store images and
 * want to generate adaptive media images. The application's images are then
 * considered when showing the total number of Adaptive Media images.

 *
 * <p>
 * Each use case or application that stores images and uses Adaptive Media
 * should create a new implementation of this class and register it as an OSGi
 * component with the property <code>adaptive.media.key</code> and a key that
 * represents the use case or application.
